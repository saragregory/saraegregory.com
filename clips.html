		<h3>Investigative reporting</h3>
		<div style="width:100%"><p>With a team from <i>The Columbus Dispatch</i>, I reported a series of stories about campus crime that showed how colleges frequently impose light punishments for violent crime. "Campus Insecurity" was published in fall 2014 and was supported in part with a grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism. For the story, I did an analysis of college crime statistics using SQL and helped create a database of college students who were found responsible for violent crime using public records obtained from colleges.</p></div>
